Hand Gesture Recognition Model


Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition model that accurately identifies and classifies various hand gestures from image or video data. The goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

Objectives
Gesture Identification: To accurately detect and classify different hand gestures from image or video inputs.
Real-time Performance: To ensure the model can process inputs and deliver results in real-time, making it suitable for interactive applications.
Robustness: To create a model that performs well under various lighting conditions, backgrounds, and hand orientations.
Dataset
The model is trained using the Leap Gesture Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset includes thousands of labeled hand gesture images, covering a range of common gestures.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Image Resizing: Standardize all images to a consistent size.
Normalization: Normalize pixel values for better model performance.
Data Augmentation: Apply transformations such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to enhance the diversity of the training data.
Model Development:

Architecture Selection: Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) due to its effectiveness in image classification tasks.
Training: Train the model using the preprocessed dataset, employing techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize performance.
Validation: Validate the model using a separate subset of the dataset to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
Evaluation:

Accuracy: Measure the classification accuracy on the test set.
Confusion Matrix: Analyze the confusion matrix to identify common misclassifications.
Real-time Testing: Test the model in real-time scenarios to evaluate its performance in practical applications.
